# ðŸ“„ PDF Merger

`merger.py` is a simple Python script that allows you to **combine multiple files (images or PDFs) into a single PDF document**.  
Images are automatically converted to PDF before merging, and the script interactively asks for the output filename.

ðŸ§¹ Notes

- Files are added to the output PDF in the exact order they are provided.

- The resulting PDF will be saved in the same directory as the script.
